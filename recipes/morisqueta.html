    <h4>Pork shoulder braised in a vibrant tomato-gaujillo chile sauce. But, where is the Morisqueta?</h4>
    <p>When I first encountered this dish, the above image was used to display the finished product. The primordial red hue of the sauce was startling and appealing. I was excited to make it. </p>
    <p>This dish is a regional Mexican dish and - judging by the picture - you might think Morisqueta is the deep red sauce and pork. However, Morisqueta is actually slang for rice. This sauce is just a Michoachan riff on the rice dish.</p>
    <p>Morisqueta Michocana, when done right is a cheap and decadent rice dish, topped with braised pork in a spicy tomato chile sauce. The sauce has incredible depth of flavor. If you are new to mexican cooking you will really enjoy experiencing the creation and consumption of this dish!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>5-6 Guajillo Chiles, stemmed and seeded</li>
        <li>2-3 Chile De Arbol, stemmed</li>
        <li>7 Large Roma tomatoes</li>
        <li>Half a white onion</li>
        <li>4 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>1 Bay leaf</li>
        <li>1 cup homemade chicken stock</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon morton kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp Oregano</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground pepper</li>
        <li>3 lbs Pork shoulder, cut into 2 inch pieces</li>
        <li>Rendered lard or olive oil</li>
        <li>Rice and beans, leftvoers okay</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees</li>
        <li>Using gloves, split the guajillo peppers open and scrap out the seeds, removing the stem. Set aside with the stemless chile de arbol.</li>
        <li>Core the roma tomatoes and set on a tray with the onion. PLace in oven and cook until the tomatoes are beginning to char</li>
        <li>Place the chiles, garlic, salt, pepper, oregano, bay leaf and the stock into a small pot. Bring to a boil and immediately remove from heat, letting the ingredients steep in the stock for 30 minutes, covered.</li>
        <li>Blend the tomaotes, onion and contents for the stock pot into a smooth red sauce.</li>
        <li>Heat 2-4 tablespoons of lard in a large heavy pot. Sear the pork, in batches, browning all sides. Remove pork and set aside. Do not hesitate to add more lard for the final few batches.</li>
        <li>In the same pot, without cleaning the pork fat and crispy bits, add the tomato chile sauce. It should be bubbling. Use a wooden spoon to deglaze the pot.</li>
        <li>After ~3-5 minutes, add the pork back in, bring the pot to a simmer, and cover for 60-90 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Serve over rice and beans. Include fresh corn tortillas if able.</li>
    </ol>
