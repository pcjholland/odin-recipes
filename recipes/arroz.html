        <h3>White rice with butter and chopped corn, carrots and peas</h3>
        <p>This rice is not the usual red spanish rice found in Mexican cooking. Instead, we get a savory buttery rice that highlights chile sauces it is served with.</p>
        <p>This rice is best served with Carrots, Corn and Peppers (such as poblano) all diced into half centimeter chunks. However, chopping the carrots nd poblano yourself can be labor intensive. So, instead, this can be made with a bag of frozen diced carrots and peas, with another bag of frozen corn. The recipe assumes you have a bag of frozen peas and carrots and some frozen corn (not canned).</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups long grain white rice, such as basmati or jasmine</li>
            <li>3 cups of chicken stock, or 3 cups of prepared Knorr Suiza or other chicken bouillon</li>
